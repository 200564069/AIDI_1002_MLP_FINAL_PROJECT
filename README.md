# Transformer-Based Sigmoid Approximation 
The Transformer-based neural network used in this repository was developed using the ideas presented in https://paperswithcode.com/paper/large-scale-legal-text-classification-using. In order to approximate the sigmoid function, the project modifies the Transformer architecture and examines its training behavior and predictions.

# Features
* Sequence-to-sequence prediction using a Transformer model.
* Visualization of the sigmoid values, both predicted and actual.
* Evaluation of model performance and training loss.
