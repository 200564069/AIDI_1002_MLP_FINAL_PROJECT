# Transformer-Based Sigmoid Approximation 
The Transformer-based neural network used in this repository was developed using the ideas presented in Large-Scale Legal Text Classification Using Transformers. In order to approximate the sigmoid function, the project modifies the Transformer architecture and examines its training behavior and predictions.
